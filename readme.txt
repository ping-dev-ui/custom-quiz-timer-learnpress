Adds a customizable timer with anti-cheat features to LearnPress quizzes, enhancing student engagement in niches like language learning or vocational skills training.

== Description ==
This plugin provides simple enhancements to LearnPress LMS quizzes, addressing gaps in automated tools for micro-courses. Key features include a per-quiz timer for timed assessments, auto-submission on timeout, and basic anti-cheat detection (e.g., tab switching) to ensure fair testing. Ideal for educators in language learning (e.g., vocabulary quizzes) or vocational skills (e.g., safety certifications), it boosts completion rates and adds gamification elements.

Features:
- Easy admin settings for custom timer duration per quiz.
- Frontend countdown display with visual styling for urgency.
- Anti-cheat mechanism that detects tab switches, alerts the user, and auto-submits the quiz.
- Auto-submission when time expires, preventing indefinite delays.
- Compatible with BuddyPress integrations for community-based learning.

Perfect for underserved sub-niches like H5P interactive content or AI-personalized quizzes. No additional dependencies required beyond LearnPress.
